When I first started using the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
Support Vector Machine (SVM) was one of those black boxes I used without really understanding how it 
worked -- well I still kinda trying to understand it in more details. Let us
see what is SVM, how to create it from scratch, and how to use it.

## Basic Description

SVMs create a line between two classes, and use the points that are the "closest" to the decision boundary as "support" for separation lines -- hence the name. It is a very rough description, so let us go in more formal understanding.

## Prerequisite: Kernel Method

Kernel method is a
